Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help
                both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a school Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and
                any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity
                is the key.</p>

Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and inimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This
            accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data. ches 2. Economics Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy
            punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Auslum Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
            <br> 3. Productivity / Efficiency Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and
            create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved
            combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits. And many more like visibility / Insights, Hassle Free Workflow Management, Flexibility, Integration / configuration,
