Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help
                both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a school Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and
                any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity
                is the key.</p>
